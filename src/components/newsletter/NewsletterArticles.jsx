    article: `FullSuite continues to strengthen its relationship with Tabuk City leadership following an initial lunch meeting at their Pinewoods residence on February 7, where Founder Maggie Po and Chief Customer Officer Zee Malota hosted the Mayor of Tabuk City, Kalinga, along with his team from PIO and DICT CAR representatives.
Building on this foundation, Po and Malota traveled to Tabuk City on March 26 for follow-up discussions regarding the city's Digital City initiatives. The meeting, held at Grand Zion Hotel, brought together the FullSuite executives with Tabuk Mayor Darwin C. Estrañero and Kalinga State University (KSU) President Dr. Joy Grace P. Doctor.
During the meeting, Po presented FullSuite's mission, vision, and internship program to KSU President Doctor, who expressed enthusiasm about forming a partnership. Doctor indicated she would propose an all-year-round collaboration with FullSuite's internship program to the university board. She also mentioned that if approved, KSU would pre-screen potential interns before recommending them to the company.
This developing partnership exemplifies FullSuite's commitment to creating internship and career opportunities for talented individuals who might otherwise be overlooked due to demographic constraints, while simultaneously supporting Tabuk City's digital transformation goals.`,

    title: `From Startup to Farm: Cat Bagsic's Journey of Growth and Transformation`,
    author: `Yani`,

    article: `Early Days: Wearing Multiple Hats
Initially, Cat joined TeeTalk- a print and customizing company affiliated with Fullsuite in 2016. Cat worked alongside Fullsuite founder Maggie where she embraced the classic startup experience—doing everything from meeting clients and managing accounts to handling HR, administration, training, and events.
This wasn't an unfamiliar territory for Cat however, who had previously worked with Maggie at Branders. During their stay at their previous company, Cat was able to establish a mentor-mentee relationship  with Maggie that would become the foundation of their professional partnership. When asked why she wanted to work at a startup like Fullsuite, Cat responded that she had trust in what the company had to offer, and that she had confidence in her abilities to help the company grow. “When you know you're good at something, then you're not really that scared,” Cat adds. 
Growth and Expansion
Cat was instrumental in Fullsuite's expansion from Manila to Baguio as she frequently traveled between the two cities to establish operations. She took pride in building the company's workforce by participating in hiring initiatives that brought the team from just five to fifty employees before her departure.
"Going from 5 to 50 employees is not a walk in the park," Cat reflects. "Before, when we were only a few, we all had multiple responsibilities. Maggie and I used to be the ones to post on our social media pages, and I was the one who had to go to different government offices and do all the paperwork filings myself."
For Cat, watching the company grow and have specialized teams take over responsibilities that she once did single-handedly remains one of the most rewarding aspects of her time at Fullsuite.
Building Culture Through Connection
Beyond operational duties, Cat prioritized team building at Fullsuite. She speaks fondly of organizing company trips, including one to Boracay during the company's early days—a milestone achievement that strengthened team bonds while demonstrating the company's commitment to a positive work culture.
When asked what’s a memory she always remembers during her time at Fullsuite, Cat laughingly remembers all the monthly employee gatherings they had. “Now, Fullsuite has these grand bi-annual company parties whereas before we were already happy with just a pizza party for our monthly meet and greets.” Cat reminisces. 
The Pandemic Pivot
When COVID-19 struck, Cat's career took an unexpected turn. What began as a temporary measure during lockdown evolved into a full business transformation as she and her husband, a construction engineer, launched a poultry farm.
"My husband and I talked about building a farm during our retirement years, but because of the pandemic, I guess our plans came into fruition earlier," she explains.
Cat credits her experience at Fullsuite for giving her the confidence to make this dramatic shift. "Finance and operations are the two skills that I really am grateful for Fullsuite because without those, I wouldn't have the guts to start our own business," she says. Despite moving from the tech industry to poultry, fruit trading, and logistics services, the foundational skills she learned from working with startups remained relevant for Cat.
Words of Advice
To current Fullsuite employees, Cat offers straightforward advice: remain open to learning. "Be receptive and broad-minded. Try to look at things differently," she urges, encouraging them to appreciate the unique learning environment that Fullsuite provides.
Furthermore, Cat wants to persuade employees to look beyond immediate challenges to see long-term benefits. She emphasizes that finance and operations knowledge is like having a "shield or armor that one can take with them on the battlefield regardless of their opponent "—wisdom clearly demonstrated by her own successful career pivot.

    title: `Where Warmth Defies the Cold`,
    author: `Aera`,
    readTime: `5 min read`,
    datePublished: `April 14, 2025`,
    article: `The night begins, and so do I,
Stepping into streets wrapped in ice-cold sighs.
The wind brushes past—a quiet sting,
Yet the city glows, alive, breathing.

Midnight strikes—the cold creeps in,
A biting chill against my skin.
Yet laughter rises, soft and bright,
Warming hearts throughout the night.

The hours pass, the grind goes on,
Work demands, yet we hold strong.
But in the pause, a gentle space,
A break, a breath—a warm embrace.

Surrounded by hearts steady and kind,
Compassionate souls, purpose aligned.
Cold should wear us down—it's true,
Yet warmth is found in all we do.

And then the morning starts to rise,
Gold spreads softly through the skies.
The air still chills, yet dawn relieves,
Embracing hearts in light and peace.

    article: `On March 21, 2025, FullSuite founder Maggie Po welcomed 19 of the company's 21 interns from the first quarter to an evening of food, conversation, and community at her Pinewoods residence. The event offered interns a chance to connect with leadership in a relaxed setting outside the office environment.
While dinner was being prepared, the interns gathered at the Pinewoods roof deck where they captured memorable photos against a backdrop of atmospheric white fog, creating images with a uniquely mysterious and moody aesthetic.
FullSuite Head of Operations June Sarmiento joined the gathering, taking time to engage with the interns and learn more about their backgrounds and experiences with the company. Meanwhile, Maggie proved to be an excellent host, serving a diverse menu featuring liempo, grilled milkfish, and chicken stew, complemented by wine and mild alcoholic beverages that helped create a comfortable atmosphere.
The evening's entertainment centered around a lively game of "Two Truths and a Lie," where participants shared three statements about themselves, challenging others to identify the false one. What began as a simple icebreaker extended into hours of conversation, punctuated by laughter and surprising personal revelations.
Aliyah, an intern from the University of the Cordilleras, shared her thoughts on the experience: "I actually enjoyed the dinner. It was a mix of food and a little bit of fun. I found it funny that when we were playing 'Two Truths and a Lie,' most of the questions were all love-related! I was expecting more serious questions, but it was a fun experience seeing everyone so energetic."
Ishan, interning from Pangasinan State University, highlighted a different aspect of the evening: "At first when the dinner was announced, I really thought it was just a simple dinner setup with food and small chitchat. But when we ate at Maggie's residence, I was surprised by everything. I especially enjoyed our engagement with Maggie when she shared her life story, how she started FullSuite, her principles in life, and some practical tips on how to build one's future."
The dinner ultimately served as both a social gathering and a valuable mentorship opportunity, allowing interns to gain insights from FullSuite's leadership while fostering stronger relationships among the team.
